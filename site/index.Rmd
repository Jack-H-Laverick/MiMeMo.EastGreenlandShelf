# MiMeMo.BarentsSea

This site details the parameterisation of StrathE2E*polar* for the Barents Sea, as part of MiMeMo. From here you can access different types of documentation.

### Sources

Details the external data sources contributing to the parameterisation. 

### Code

Details the dependencies between, and run times of, the R scripts processing original data sources. The dependencies are updated every time the site is built. The run times must be saved out after batch-processing the project code.

### Checks

Collects the visual data checks performed during data processing. This page allows descriptions to accompany each of the checks. The checks are imported from the project every time the site is built.

### Notes

Details the reasoning behind choices made during the development of the project pipeline. This includes things like defining the geographic extent of the model domain, and accommodating deep convection. These notes are cached to speed up the rendering of the site.

### Greenland

Provides a link to the sister site for the East Greenland Shelf parameterisation of StrathE2E*polar*.
